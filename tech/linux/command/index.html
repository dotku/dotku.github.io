      <pre>There are thousands of commands to do every task imaginable, but here are the most
      important commands with their most used options:

man [-k] {name of command/keyword}

Manual of given command. If the "-k" option is used it searches manual pages for the keyword.

cd {path}

Change Directory to the given path.

ls [-a]

Lists all files and folders in current directory. The "-a" option lists hidden files as well.

pwd

Print Working Directory. Tells you what directory you are in.

cp {path to source} {path to target}

Copies the source file to the target location.

mv {path to source} {path to target}

Moves the source file to the target location. Can be used to rename files by putting the new name as
the target.

rm [-r,f] {path to file}

Deletes file at given path. The "-r" option removes deletes all files and folders within given
directory (if directory is given). The "-f" will make rm not prompt you when deleting files, and is
usually used with "-r" so that it does not prompt you repeatedly.

nano {path to file}

A simple in-terminal file editor. If file at path given does not exist it creates it. Note: If a
tutorial online ever uses vi/vim/ed/pico in a command, replace it with nano. Those are other
editors, which while great, are harder to use.

mkdir {name}

Makes a directory with the name specified.

rmdir {name}

Removes a directory with the name specified.

cat {path to file}

Returns the contents of a file.

chmod [+x]

Changes the permissions of a file. The "+x" option is not preceded by a dash and is used to allow a
file to be executable.

ps aux | grep {keyword}

Find the running process with the keyword

passwd {username}

Change the user's password

adduser {username}

Add a user with {username}</pre>
