## About

Welcome!  

Here is my github space, I will experiment some front end web tech 
code over here, while other back end code will place on my personal 
website weijinglin.name.  

Please read up the code by your self; even though, most are disorganized.
I might release some tutorial session in the future, but right now, I'm 
just working some web project and doing research on them.  
Just follow me.  

Thank you,

Welcome to my github space, I current just reconstruct the folders,
make them separated by languages, inlcuding [English] and [Chinese].
I guest it would be a better way for construct the content.

[English]: '/en'
[Chinese]: '/cn'
