## About

Welcome!  

Here is my github space, I will experiment some front end web tech 
code over here, while other back end code will place on my personal 
website weijinglin.name.  

Please read up the code by your self; even though, most are disorganized.
I might release some tutorial session in the future, but right now, I'm 
just working some web project and doing research on them.  
Just follow me.  

Thank you,

## Updates

Welcome to my github space, I current just reconstruct the folders,
make them separated by languages, inlcuding [English] and [Chinese].
I guest it would be a better way for construct the content.

想了想，还是想要把中英文合并在一起，分离的工作量还真不小，
而且有时候又想写中文，有时候又想写英文，心情难以琢磨（我也不太了解我自己呀)。

## Plan
- 计划整合中英文资源。

[English]: en
[Chinese]: cn
