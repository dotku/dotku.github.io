Hi everyone,

This is my personal website hosted on github. I will use this page to repersent some of 
my personal projects.

## Plan
- Study Hadhood
- Clean up this repo (someone is complaining that my page is not useful 
[[via](https://github.com/dotku/dotku.github.io/issues/2)])

## Credit
- Family

  Thanks to my wife and my family support, without their help to take care of my children,
  I might not have time to learn and contribute to the community.

- Friends 

  There are many friends online and offline. They gave me many advice, feedback and share,
  which inspired me and help me grow.

- Collegues and Managers

  I feel very luck to work with a group of telent people, smart, and passnate on their work.
  I learn a lot from my collegues and managers. I used to list their names, but I feel it is 
  just too many people I should list, and I'm also worry if I missed someone, it would hurt 
  other people.

- Github

  Special thanks to the github. With generous free almost unlimted hosting space which 
  helps me grow my technology skills.

- You

  Thanks for visit my page. I don't know maybe you just visit by accident, but if you have 
  anything want to share with me. Welcome to leave message over here:
